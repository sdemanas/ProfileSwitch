# Stopping Development

There is already an existing extension and it uses an extneral tool to make calls to firefox 
https://github.com/null-dev/firefox-profile-switcher

I wanted to create something more native, but it seems Firefox has caught up to this 
This feature is already a part of Firefox Nightly it seems and will be implemented soon 
in the stable version of the app.

So I will stall my efforts on this for the time being.

# ProfileSwitch
A firefox extension that lets you switch between different profiles just like Chrome
