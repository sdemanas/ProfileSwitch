# ProfileSwitch
A firefox extension that lets you switch between different profiles just like Chrome

# Stopping Development

There is already an existing extension and it uses an extneral tool to make calls to firefox 
https://github.com/null-dev/firefox-profile-switcher

I wanted to create something more native, but it seems Firefox has caught up to this.

The feature is already a part of Firefox Nightly might be implemented soon 
in the stable versions.

Will stall my efforts on this for the time being.
